To compute the ratio directly from histograms run:   *correct_fakerates_year_histo.py*

To fit the turn on curve and then extrapolate the efficiency by eta bins:
 - first run the correct_fakerates_graph script to produce turn on curves
 - then use  *correct_fakerates_fit.py* to fit the curves and produce R factor plots.
